Command Line Interface
----------------------

The Tapis command-line interface (CLI) is an complete interface to the Tapis REST API. The scripts include support for creating persistent authentication sessions, creating/renaming apps, registering and sharing systems, uploading and managing data, creating PostIts, etc. For existing projects looking to leverage Tapis for back-end processing, for users wishing to integrate Tapis into their existing scripted solutions, or for those new to Tapis who just want to kick the tires, the Tapis CLI is a powerful tool for all of these things. The Tapis CLI can be checked out from the Tapis git repository.

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/TACC/agavepy
