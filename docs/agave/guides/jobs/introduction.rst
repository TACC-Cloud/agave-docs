Jobs
----

The Jobs service is a basic execution service that allows you to run applications registered with the Apps service across multiple, distributed, heterogeneous systems through a common REST interface. The service manages all aspects of execution and job management from data staging, job submission, monitoring, output archiving, event logging, sharing, and notifications. The Jobs service also provides a persistent reference to your job's output data and a mechanism for sharing all aspects of your job with others. Each feature will be described in more detail in the following section.
