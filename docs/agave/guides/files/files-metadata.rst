File metadata management
========================

In many systems, the concept of metadata is directly tied to the notion of a file system. Tapis (Agave) takes a broader view of metadata and supports it as its own first class resource in the REST API. For more information on how to leverage metadata in Tapis (Agave), please consult the :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="https://tacc-cloud.readthedocs.io/projects/agave/en/latest/agave/guides/metadata/introduction.html" title="Metadata Tutorial">Metadata Guide</a>`. In there we cover all aspects of how to manage, search, validate, and associate metadata across your entire digital lab.
