File metadata management
========================

In many systems, the concept of metadata is directly tied to the notion of a file system. Tapis takes a broader view of metadata and supports it as its own first class resource in the REST API. For more information on how to leverage metadata in Tapis, please consult the :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="https://tacc-cloud.readthedocs.io/projects/agave/en/latest/agave/guides/metadata/introduction.html" title="Metadata Tutorial">Metadata Guide</a>`. In there we cover all aspects of how to manage, search, validate, and associate metadata across your entire digital lab.
