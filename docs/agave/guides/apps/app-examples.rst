One thing we learned very early on was that your science and the ways in which you conduct your science are as unique as you are. That's one of the reasons that Tapis leaves so much of the app registration process open for interpretation. By giving you total flexibility in how you define your app, you can craft a better user experience for your end users.

To help illustrate the the flexibility you have in defining your apps, we show 3 examples of how the same app can be defined with a low, moderate, and high degree of detail. In each example, we demonstrate how the level of detail available in the app can can impact the end user experience.

The app we use is a plotting app written in Python. This should allow you to register and run the app for yourself on your own system if you wish. We hope you can use these examples as references, for inspiration, or clone their git repositories and use them as templates. However you use them, we hope they help you better conduct your science your way.
