Wrapper Templates
=================

In order to run your application, you will need to create a wrapper template that calls your executable code. The wrapper template is a simple script that Tapis will filter and execute to start your app. The filtering Tapis applies to your wrapper script is to inject runtime values from a job request into the script to replace the template variables representing the inputs and parameters of your app.

The order in which wrapper templates are processed in HPC and Condor apps is as follows.


#. ``environment`` variables injected.
#. ``startupScript`` run.
#. Scheduler directives prepended to the wrapper template.
#. ``additionalDirectives`` concatenated after the scheduler directives.
#. Custom ``modules`` concatenated after the additionalDirectives.
#. ``inputs`` and ``parameters`` template variables replaced with values from the job request.
#. Blacklist commands, if present, are disabled in the scripts.
#. Resulting script is written to the remote job execution folder and executed.

The order in which wrapper templates are processed in CLI apps is as follows.


#. Shell environment sourced
#. ``environment`` variables injected
#. ``startupScript`` run
#. Custom ``modules`` prepended to the top of the wrapper
#. ``inputs`` and ``parameters`` template variables replaced with values from the  job request
#. Blacklist commands, if present, are disabled in the scripts.
#. Resulting script is forked into the background immediately.

Environment
-----------

Comes from the system definition. Handle in your script if you cannot change the system definition to suit your needs. Ship whatever you need with your app's assets.

Modules
-------

See more about :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="http://modules.sourceforge.net/" title="The Environment Modules Project" target="_blank">Modules</a>` and :raw-html-m2r:`<a href="https://github.com/TACC/Lmod" title="Lmod: An Environment Module System based on Lua" target="_blank">Lmod</a>`. Can be used to customize your environment, locate your application, and improve portability between systems. Tapis does not install or manage the module installation on a particular system, however it does know how to interact with it. Specifying the modules needed to run your app either in your wrapper template or in your system definition can greatly help you during the development process.

Default job macros
------------------

Tapis provides information about the job, system, and user as predefined macros you can use in your wrapper templates. The full list of  runtime job macros are give in the following table.

Input data
----------

Tapis will stage the files and folders you specify as inputs to your app. These will be available in the top level of your job directory at runtime. Additionally, the names of each of the inputs will be injected into your wrapper template for you to use in your application logic. Please be aware that Tapis will not attempt to resolve namespace conflicts between your app inputs. That means that if a job specifies two inputs with the same name, one will overwrite the other during the input staging phase of the job and, though the variable names will be correctly injected to the wrapper script, your job will most likely fail due to missing data.

See the table below for fields that must be defined for an app's inputs:

Variable injection
------------------

If you refer back to the app definition we used in the App Management Tutorial, you will see there are multiple inputs and parameters defined for that app. Each input and parameter object had an ``id`` attribute. That ``id`` value is the attribute name you use to associate runtime values with app inputs and parameters. When a job is submitted to Tapis, prior to physically running the wrapper template, all instances of that ``id`` are replaced with the actual value from the job request. The example below shows our app description, a job request, and the resulting wrapper template at run time.

Type declarations
-----------------

During the jobs submission process, Tapis will store your inputs and parameters as serialized JSON. At the point that variable injection occurs, Tapis will replace all occurrences of your input and parameter with their value provided in the job request. In order for Tapis to properly identify your input and parameter ids, wrap them in brackets and prepend a dollar sign. For example, if you have a parameter with id ``param1``\ , you would include it in your wrapper script as ``${param1}``. Case sensitivity is honored at all times.

Boolean values
--------------

Boolean values are passed in as truthy values. true = 1, false is empty.

Cardinality
-----------

Cardinality is not used in resolving wrapper template variables.

Parameter Flags
---------------

If your parameter was of type "flag", Tapis will replace all occurences of the template variable with the value you provided for the ``argument`` field.

App packaging
-------------

Tapis API apps have a generalized structure that allows them to carry dependencies around with them. In the case below, ``package-name-version.dot.dot</em>`` is a folder that you build on your local system, then store in your Tapis Cloud Storage in a designated location (we recommend ``/home/username/applications/app_folder_name``\ ). It contains binaries, support scripts, test data, etc. all in one package. Tapis basically uses a very rough form of containerized applications (more on this later). We suggest you set your apps up to look something like the following:

.. code-block::

   package-name-version.dot.dot
   |--system_name
   |----bin.tgz (optional)
   |----lib.tgz (optional)
   |----include.tgz (optional)
   |----test.sh
   |----script.template
   |----test_data (optional)
   |----app.json

Tapis runs a job by first transferring a copy of this directory into temporary directory on the target ``executionSystem``. Then, the input data files (we'll show you how to specify those are later) are staged into place automatically. Next, Tapis writes a scheduler submit script (using a template you provide i.e. script.template) and puts it in the queue on the target system. The Tapis service then monitors progress of the job and, assuming it completes, copies all newly-created files to the location specified when the job was submitted. Along the way, critical milestones and metadata are recorded in the job's history.

:raw-html-m2r:`<em>Tapis app development proceeds via the following steps:</em>`


#. Build the application locally on the ``executionSystem``
#. Ensure that you are able to run it directly on the ``executionSystem``
#. Describe the application using a Tapis app description
#. Create a shell template for running the app
#. Upload the application directory to a ``storageSystem``
#. Post the app description to the Tapis apps service
#. Debug your app by running jobs and updating the app until it works as intended
#. (Optional) Share the app with some friends to let them test it

   :information_source: Note: If the app you are working on doesn't natively produce output with a predictable name, one thing you can do is add extra logic to your script to take the existing output and rename it to something you can control or predict.
