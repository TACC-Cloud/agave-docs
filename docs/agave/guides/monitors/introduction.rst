Monitors
========

The Tapis Monitors API provides a familiar paradigm for monitoring the usability and
accessibility of storage and execution systems you registered with Tapis.

Similar to services like Pingdom, Pagerduty, and WebCron, the Monitors API allows you to to
create regular health checks on a registered system. Unlike standard uptime services,
Tapis will check that your system is responsive and accessible by performing
proactive tests on availability (ping), accessibility (authentication), and
functionality (listing or echo). Each check result is persisted and the check
history of a given monitor is queryable through the API.

As with all resources in the Tapis Platform, a full event model is available so you can subscribe to
event you care about such as failed checks, restored system availability, and system disablement. 

----

Creating Monitors
-----------------

Create a new default monitor with the following command:


.. code-block:: shell

        curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application-json" \
            -X POST --data-binary '{"target": "storage.example.com"}' \
            https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/monitors/v2/
|

.. container:: foldable

     .. container:: header

        :fa:`caret-right`
        **Show json response**

     .. code-block:: json

        {
            "active": true,
            "created": "2016-06-03T17:22:59.000-05:00",
            "frequency": 60,
            "id": "5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014",
            "internalUsername": null,
            "lastCheck": null,
            "lastSuccess": null,
            "lastUpdated": "2016-06-03T17:22:59.000-05:00",
            "nextUpdate": "2016-06-03T18:22:59.000-05:00",
            "owner": "nryan",
            "target": "storage.example.com",
            "updateSystemStatus": false,
            "_links": {
                "checks": {
                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/monitor/v2/5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014/checks"
                },
                "notifications": {
                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/notifications/v2/?associatedUuid=5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014"
                },
                "owner": {
                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/profiles/v2/nryan"
                },
                "self": {

                },
                "system": {
                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/v2/storage.example.com"
                }
            }
        }
|


The only piece of information needed to monitor a system is the system ID.
Sending a POST request to the Monitors API with a monitor definition containing just
the ``systemId`` field with a valid system ID or UUID will create a monitor that will run
hourly health checks starting an hour from when you sent the request.  

*You cannot create monitors on systems for which you do not have a role.*

----

Custom frequency and start time
-------------------------------

Create a monitor with a custom frequency with the following command:


.. code-block:: shell

        curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application-json" \
            -X POST --data-binary '{"target": "storage.example.com","frequency":15}' \
            https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/monitors/v2/
|

                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/monitor/v2/5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014/checks"
                },
                "notifications": {
                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/notifications/v2/?associatedUuid=5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014"
                },
                "owner": {
                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/profiles/v2/nryan"
                },
                "self": {

                },
                "system": {
                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/v2/storage.example.com"
                }
            },
            "active": true,
            "created": "2016-06-03T17:22:59.000-05:00",
            "frequency": 15,
            "id": "5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014",
            "internalUsername": null,
            "lastCheck": null,
            "lastSuccess": null,
            "lastUpdated": "2016-06-03T17:22:59.000-05:00",

            "owner": "nryan",
            "target": "storage.example.com",
            "updateSystemStatus": false
        }
|


If you need the monitor to run more frequently, you can customize the frequency and time
at which a monitor runs by including the ``interval`` and ``startTime`` fields in your monitor definition.

By providing a time expression in the ``interval`` field, you can control the frequency at
which a monitor runs. The maximum interval you can set for a monitor is one month. The
minimum interval varies from tenant to tenant, but is generally no less than 5 minutes. 

The ``startTime`` field allows you to schedule when you would like Tapis to start the
monitor on your system. Any date or time expression representing a moment between the
current time and one month from then is acceptable. If you do not specify a value for
``startTime``\ , Tapis will add the value of ``interval`` to the current time and use that as
the ``startTIme``.

*Setting stop times or "off hours" is not currently supported.*

----

Automating system status updates
--------------------------------

Create a monitor that updates system status on change with the following command:


.. code-block:: shell

        curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application-json" \
            -X POST \
            --data-binary '{"target": "storage.example.com","frequency":15,"updateSystemStatus"=true}' \
            https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/monitors/v2/

            "nextUpdate": "2016-06-03T17:37:59.000-05:00",
            "owner": "nryan",
            "target": "storage.example.com",
            "updateSystemStatus": true,
            "_links": {
                "checks": {
                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/monitor/v2/5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014/checks"

                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/profiles/v2/nryan"
                },
                "self": {

                }
            }
        }
|


In the Events and Notifications sections, we cover the ways in which you can get alerted about events
pertaining to a monitor. Here we will simply point out that a convenience field, ``updateStatus``\ ,
is built into all monitors. Setting this field to ``true`` will authorize Tapis to update the status
of the monitored system based on the result of the monitor checks. This is a convenient way to
ensure that the status value in your system description matches the actual operational status of the system.

*To automatically update your system status when a monitor changes status, set
``updateStatus`` to ``true`` in your monitor definition.*

----

Updating an existing monitor

                }
            }
        }
|


Monitors can be managed by making traditional GET, POST, and DELETE operations.
When updating a monitor, pay attention to the response because the time of the
next check will change. In fact, any change to a monitor will recalculate the time
when the next health check will run. 

----

Disabling an existing monitor

                }
            }
        }
|


There may be times when you need to pause a monitor. If your system has scheduled
maintenance periods, you may want to disable the monitor until the maintenance period
ends. You can do this by making a PUT request on a monitor with the a field name ``action``
set to "disabled". While disabled, all health checks will be skipped. 

----

Enabling an existing monitor
----------------------------

Enable an existing monitor with the following command:


.. code-block:: shell

        curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"
            -H "Content-Type: application/json"
            -X PUT --data-binary '{"action": "enable"}'

                    "href": "https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/v2/storage.example.com"
                }
            }
        }
|


Similarly, to enable a monitor, make a PUT request with the a field name ``action`` set to
"enabled". Once reenabled, the monitor will resume its previous check schedule as
specified in the ``nextUpdate`` field, or immediately if that time has already expired.

----

Deleting a monitor
------------------

Deleting an existing monitor with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

        curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"
            -H "Content-Type: application/json"
            -X DELETE
            https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/monitors/v2/5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014
|

   An empty response will be returned


To delete a monitor, simply make a DELETE request on the monitor.

*Unlike systems, deleting a monitor will permanently delete the monitor and all its history, checks, etc.*

----

Monitor Checks
--------------

Listing past monitor checks with the following command:

Each instance of a monitor testing a system is called a Check. Monitor Checks are
persisted over time and query able as a collection of a monitor resource. Monitor checks
can be queried by result, timeframe, and type. By default, the last check is injected into
a monitor description as the ``lastCheck`` field. 

Each monitor check has a unique ID and represents a formal, addressable resource in the
API. Here we see a typical successful monitor check. Checks will have one of two
states: PASSED or FAILED. Successful monitors have a status of PASSED and no message.
Unsuccessful monitors have a status of FAILED and a message describing why they failed.

Searching check history for a monitor with the following command:


.. code-block:: shell

        curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"

Long-running monitor checks can build up a large history which can become prohibitive
to page through. When generating graphs and looking for specific incidents, you can
search for specific checks based on ``result``\ , ``startTime``\ , ``endTime``\ , ``type``\ , and ``id``.
The standard JSON SQL search syntax used across the rest of the Science APIs is supported
for monitor checks as well.

Manually running a check
------------------------

Force a monitor check to run with the following command:


.. code-block:: shell

        curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application-json" \
            -X POST --data-binary '{}' \
            https://api.tacc.utexas.edu/monitors/v2/5024717285821443610-242ac11f-0001-014/checks

If you need to verify the accessibility of your system, or behavior of your monitor, you
can force an existing monitor to run on demand by sending a POST request to the monitor
checks collection. When doing this, you are still subject to the same minimum check
interval configured for your tenant. 

*When manually forcing a monitor to run, you are still subject to
the same minimum check interval configured for your tenant.*
