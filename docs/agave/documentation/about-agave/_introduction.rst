What is the Tapis Platform?
---------------------------

The Tapis Platform (\ `Tapis readthedocs <https://tacc-cloud.readthedocs.io/projects/agave/en/latest/`_\ ) is an open source, science-as-a-service API platform for
powering your digital lab. Tapis allows you to bring together your public, private, and shared high performance
computing (HPC), high throughput computing (HTC), Cloud, and Big Data resources under a single, web-friendly REST API.

    *webhooks, rest, json, cors, OAuth2*

*

The Tapis documentation site contains information, tutorials, and lots of examples to help you build your own digital lab.
