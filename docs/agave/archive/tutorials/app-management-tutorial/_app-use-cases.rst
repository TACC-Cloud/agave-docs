In developing the Tapis Platform, we spend a lot of time listening to the use cases you share with us. In fact, it was because of the requests from hundreds of scientists and developers, like you, asking for a better way to piece together their digital lab that Tapis was created. You could say that use cases are part of our DNA.

One thing we learned very early on was that your science and the ways in which you conduct your science are as unique as you are. That's one of the reasons that Tapis leaves so much of the app registration process open for interpretation. By giving you total flexibility in how you define your app, you can craft a better user experience for your end users.

To help illustrate the the flexibility you have in defining your apps, we have collected several use cases and how real world users solved them with Tapis. You can use these examples as references, for inspiration, or clone their git repositories and use them as templates. The choice is entirely up to you.
