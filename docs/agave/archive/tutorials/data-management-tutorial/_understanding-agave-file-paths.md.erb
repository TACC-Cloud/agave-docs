One potentially confusing feature of Tapis is its support for virtualizing systems paths. Every registered system specifies both a root directory, `rootDir`, and a home directory, `homeDir` attribute in its storage configuration. `rootDir` tells Tapis the absolute path on the remote system that it should treat as `/`. Similar to the Linux `chroot` command; no requests made to Tapis will ever be resolved to locations outside of `rootDir`.

`homeDir` specifies the path, relative to `rootDir`, that Tapis should use for relative paths. Since Tapis is stateless, there is no concept of a current working directory. Thus, when you specify a path to Tapis that does not begin with a `/`, Tapis will always prefix the path with the value of `homeDir`. The following table gives several examples of how different combinations of `rootDir`, `homeDir`, and URL paths will be resolved by Tapis.
